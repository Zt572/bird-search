## _Dataset Credits_
All credit goes to Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. See the README in the [dataset itself](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/) for more information. A huge thank you to the Caltech Vision Lab for making this dataset (amongst several others) publicly available, even going so far as to transition their datasets to newer hosting services.
